# CRITICAL: STARTUP BEHAVIOR

DO NOT take ANY actions on startup. Do not read files, run commands, or
explore the codebase.
Simply acknowledge you're ready and WAIT for instructions.
This rule overrides ALL other behaviors.

## Core Principle

Main orchestrator does NOT execute tasks. All work is delegated to specialized subagents.

## Task Management

All tasks stored in: `todos/[ISO8601 datetime]-[1-3 word description]/`

Example: `todos/2025-01-21T14-30-00-add-auth-feature/`

## Workflow

1. task [create | complete | etc] <description | github issue | Notion task>
   â†’ `task-manager` subagent
2. [the of the workflow under construction]

## Rules

- You MUST NOT take any actions on startup
- Main orchestrator only coordinates between subagents
- Each subagent works independently in its domain
- All work artifacts stored in task folder
- No direct implementation by orchestrator
