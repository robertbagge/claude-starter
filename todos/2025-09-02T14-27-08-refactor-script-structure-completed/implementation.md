# Implementation Progress: Refactor Todo Script Structure

## Status: COMPLETED

## Progress Tracking

### Step 1: Create Shared Directory Structure ✅

- [x] Create `.claude/commands/todo/scripts/shared/` directory
- [x] Move existing utility scripts to shared folder

### Step 2: Update Shared Scripts ✅

- [x] Check and update script-to-script references (No updates needed -
  scripts don't call each other)

### Step 3: Create Main Command Scripts ✅

- [x] Create `create.sh`
- [x] Create `list.sh`
- [x] Create `complete.sh`

### Step 4: Update Command Markdown Files ✅

- [x] Update `create.md`
- [x] Update `list.md`
- [x] Update `complete.md`

### Step 5: Testing & Validation ✅

- [x] Test all commands
- [x] Verify paths and permissions

## Implementation Log

### [2025-09-02 15:00] - Starting Implementation

- Read implementation_plan.md
- Created this implementation.md file
- Ready to begin Step 1

### [2025-09-02 16:02] - Step 1 Completed

- Created `.claude/commands/todo/scripts/shared/` directory
- Moved all 6 utility scripts to shared folder:

  - todo_create_folder.sh
  - todo_create_index.sh
  - todo_get_folder_name.sh
  - todo_list_tasks_reverse.sh
  - todo_rename_completed.sh
  - todo_verify_folder.sh

### [2025-09-02 16:04] - Step 2 & 3 Completed

- Checked shared scripts - no inter-script references found
- Created 3 main command scripts:

  - create.sh - orchestrates folder creation workflow
  - list.sh - lists todos in reverse chronological order
  - complete.sh - renames folder from -open to -completed
- Made all scripts executable

### [2025-09-02 16:07] - Step 4 Completed

- Updated all command markdown files to use single script calls:

  - create.md - calls create.sh with identifier
  - list.md - calls list.sh
  - complete.md - calls complete.sh with folder name
- Preserved special AI agent instructions in create.md
- Removed references to non-existent scripts

### [2025-09-02 16:11] - Step 5 Completed - Testing & Validation

- Fixed template path in todo_create_index.sh
  (.claude/templates/todos/)
- Successfully tested all commands:

  - create.sh - creates todo folder with proper structure
  - list.sh - lists todos in reverse chronological order
  - complete.sh - renames folder from -open to -completed
- All paths and permissions verified working correctly

## ✅ Refactoring Complete

The todo script structure has been successfully refactored according to the
implementation plan:

### Summary of Changes

1. **Moved utility scripts to shared folder**: All 6 scripts moved to
   `.claude/commands/todo/scripts/shared/`
2. **Created main command scripts**: 3 new scripts (`create.sh`, `list.sh`,
   `complete.sh`) that orchestrate the workflows
3. **Updated markdown files**: All command `.md` files now reference single
   scripts
4. **Fixed template path**: Corrected path to
   `.claude/templates/todos/task-index-template.md`
5. **Tested all functionality**: All commands work correctly

### New Structure

```text
.claude/commands/todo/
├── scripts/
│   ├── create.sh      # Main create command
│   ├── list.sh        # Main list command  
│   ├── complete.sh    # Main complete command
│   └── shared/        # Utility scripts
├── create.md          # Uses create.sh
├── list.md           # Uses list.sh
└── complete.md       # Uses complete.sh
```

The refactoring maintains all existing functionality while providing a
cleaner, more maintainable structure with single entry points for each
command.

## Suggested PR Description

```text
# Refactor todo script structure for better maintainability

## Summary

Refactored the todo command scripts to use a single entry point per command,
improving maintainability and creating cleaner separation between command
logic and utility functions.

## Changes Made

- Moved all utility scripts to `.claude/commands/todo/scripts/shared/`
  folder
- Created single main scripts for each command (`create.sh`, `list.sh`,
  `complete.sh`)
- Updated command markdown files to reference single scripts instead of
  multiple script calls
- Fixed template path reference to use correct `.claude/templates/todos/`
  location
- Preserved all existing functionality and AI agent instructions

## Benefits

- Cleaner command structure with single entry points
- Better separation of concerns (utilities vs command logic)
- Easier maintenance and testing
- Consistent script organization

## Testing

All commands tested and verified working correctly:

- ✅ `create.sh` - creates todo folders with proper structure
- ✅ `list.sh` - lists todos in reverse chronological order  
- ✅ `complete.sh` - renames folders from -open to -completed

No breaking changes - all existing functionality preserved.
