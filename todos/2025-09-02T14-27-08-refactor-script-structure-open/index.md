# Todo: refactor-script-structure

## Description

refactor todo script structure to have a single script for each todo command. Existing scripts in @.claude/commands/todo/scripts should be moved to @.claude/commands/todo/scripts/shared and then we should add a new script for each command that calls out to it's necessary scripts.

@.claude/commands/todo/scripts/create.sh
@.claude/commands/todo/scripts/list.sh

etc.

Each command should just refer to their one .sh command in the ## steps section. For example the @.claude/commands/todo/create.md should just call out to `@claude/commands/todo/scripts/create.sh`.
The "generate identifier" and "edit the index file instructions" should be intact
