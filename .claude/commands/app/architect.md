# app-architecture

Run the `app-architect` agent to produce evidence-backed research and repo-ready configs.  
Outputs **complexity** (not time) and does **not** create an implementation plan.

## Usage

/app:architect [@todo/<folder-name>] <architect topic or question>

## Examples

/app:architect @todo/2025-09-05-renovate-setup Renovate bot setup for monorepo with asdf, bun workspaces, and uv
/app:architect @todo/2025-07-08-upgrade-react-native-and-expo-to-latest-versions

## What it does

1. Launches `app-architect` with description of where to find existing todo research and task description
2. Writes `@todo/<folder-name>/architecture.md` and updates `index.md`.
3. Creates a git commit for branch with the research
